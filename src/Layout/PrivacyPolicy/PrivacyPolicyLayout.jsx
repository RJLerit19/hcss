              On websites to which you logon, we may connect this information

              information that your browser sends to every website you visit,
              such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address, your browser type and
              capabilities and language, your operating system, the date and

              Use of Cookies

            <p className="text-xl font-lato tracking-wide">
              Cookies are small files that websites save to your hard disk or to
              your browser's memory. Our websites may use them to track the
              number of times you have visited the website, to track the number
              of visitors to the website, to determine and analyze visitors' use
              of our websites, to store data that you provide (such as your
              preferences), and to store technical information related to your
              interactions with our websites. We may also use session cookies,
              which are deleted when you close your browser, to store your user
              ID, to facilitate your movement around our websites (particularly
              in connection with information searches and order placement) and
              other information useful in administering the session. In some
              cases, we may use information collected through analytics cookies
              or advertising cookies to target advertising at website visitors
              or make advertising messages more relevant to you.

            <p className="text-xl font-lato tracking-wide">
              Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can
              usually modify your browser settings to decline cookies or to
              notify you when a cookie is being placed on your computer. If you
              choose not to accept cookies, you may not be able to experience
              all of the features of our websites. Internet browsers also enable
              you to delete existing cookies, although this means that your
              existing settings (including stored user IDs and other
              preferences) will be lost. Some web browsers may also give you the
              ability to enable a “do not track” setting. This setting sends a
              signal to the websites you encounter while web browsing. This “do
              not track” signal is different from disabling certain forms of
              tracking by declining cookies in your browser settings, as
              browsers with the “do not track” setting enabled may still accept
              cookies. HCSS does not respond to web browser “do not track”
              signals at this time. If we do so in the future, we will describe
              how we do so in this Privacy Statement.
